	Abstract = {In this work, we present a multi-camera surveillance system based on the use of self-organizing neural networks to represent events on video. The system processes several tasks in parallel using GPUs (graphic processor units). It addresses multiple vision tasks at various levels, such as segmentation, representation or characterization, analysis and monitoring of the movement. These features allow the construction of a robust representation of the environment and interpret the behavior of mobile agents in the scene. It is also necessary to integrate the vision module into a global system that operates in a complex environment by receiving images from multiple acquisition devices at video frequency. Offering relevant information to higher level systems, monitoring and making decisions in real time, it must accomplish a set of requirements, such as: time constraints, high availability, robustness, high processing speed and re-configurability. We have built a system able to represent and analyze the motion in video acquired by a multi-camera network and to process multi-source data in parallel on a multi-GPU architecture.},

abstract = {Any robot should be provided with a proper representation of its environment in order to perform navigation and other tasks. In addition to metrical approaches, topological mapping generates graph representations in which nodes and edges correspond to locations and transitions. In this article, we present LexToMap, a topological mapping procedure that relies on image annotations. These annotations, represented in this work by lexical labels, are obtained from pre-trained deep learning models, namely CNNs, and are used to estimate image similarities. Moreover, the lexical labels contribute to the descriptive capabilities of the topological maps. The proposal has been evaluated using the KTH-IDOL 2 dataset, which consists of image sequences acquired within an indoor environment under three different lighting conditions. The generality of the procedure as well as the descriptive capabilities of the generated maps validate the proposal.},
